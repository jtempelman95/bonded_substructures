"""Linear elasticity solver using dolfinx (future implementation)."""

# Placeholder for future FE solver implementation
# This will include:
# - Linear elasticity formulation
# - Assembly of stiffness and mass matrices
# - Static and dynamic analysis
# - Integration with dolfinx finite element library

# Example future API:
#
# from bonded_substructures.solver import LinearElasticitySolver
#
# solver = LinearElasticitySolver(mesh, materials)
# solver.apply_boundary_conditions(...)
# solver.solve()
# results = solver.get_results()
